// Client side file
1. tailwind.config.ts file for the functions
2. lucide react module and layout file
3. redux.tsx file
4. fixed the issue related to fs and path module in seed.ts by modifying the tsconfig.json by  :
-> uncommenting module from commonjs to nodenext
-> uncommenting moduleResolution from node10 to nodenext
-> uncommented the resolveJsonModule: true
-> uncommented outDir: "./" to "./dist"
