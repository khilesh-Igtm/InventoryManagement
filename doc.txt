// Client side file
1. tailwind.config.ts file for the functions
2. lucide react module and layout file
3. redux.tsx file
4. fixed the issue related to fs and path module in seed.ts by modifying the tsconfig.json by  :
-> uncommenting module from commonjs to nodenext
-> uncommenting moduleResolution from node10 to nodenext
-> uncommented the resolveJsonModule: true
-> uncommented outDir: "./" to "./dist"

//Backend Packages
-> rimraf , concurrently, helmet, morgan
-> devDependencies using -D for typescript use @types/package-name
-> scripts commands also

// frontend CardPurchaseSummary files
-> why we called const{data: dashboardMetrics, isLoading} = useGetDashboardMerticsQuery(); 
in each child component why we don't pass in parent in Dashboard component and pass it as a prop.

from CardPurchaseSummary , understand this line ->  {lastDataPoint.changePercentage! >= 0 ? . ! >= means.
 

.reduce method in js inside CardExpenseSummary.
-> Inventory/page.tsx for material UI design work to form DataGrid

-> FormEvent<HTMLFormElement> inside our Products/CreateProductModal

-> backend -> expenseController
-> frontend -> expense/page.tsx

difference in this 
are these structure the same 
-> type AggregatedDataItem = {
  name: string;
  color?: string;
  amount: number;
};


and interface SidebarLinkProps {
  href: string;
  icon: LucideIcon;
  label: string;
  isCollapsed: boolean;
}
